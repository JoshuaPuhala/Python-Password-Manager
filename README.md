# Python-Password-Manager
Python password manager created for a class final project, looking to improve upon the basic foundation I've created here.
This program is the least secure thing called a "password manager" I can think of, so I will be working on increasing security for the program accross the board including but not limited to: File encryption, Password hash/salting, reworking data storage to not include client side files, improved API functionality, etc. The actual README is in the initial commit as README
